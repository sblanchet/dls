# About

DLS is a nice Data Logging Service from Etherlab
https://www.etherlab.org/en/dls

Unfortunately, some portions of this software are only available in German.
Therefore I have translated the full software in English.

## What I have done?
* Import the mercurial repository http://sourceforge.net/p/dls/code into Git
* Search for German strings in the code and replace them with English ones
* Publish the result on GitHub

## Notes
* I have used Google Translation because I do not understand German.
* My work is based on the revision 857:ba8b1ff1ad87 in the original mercurial repository
hosted on Sourceforge.
* I will try to synchronize regularly with the original code
